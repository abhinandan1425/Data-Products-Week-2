### Creating My First Map using Leaflet

I am going to create a map that shows the location of The Taj Mahal in Agra, India.


First we will load the library 'leaflet' using following command:

```{r}
library(leaflet)
```

Now to create a map, we will use following R code:


```{r}
map <- leaflet() %>%
addTiles()
map
```

Finally, I am going to create a link to the official site of Taj Mahal from where I could get relevant information.

```{r}
Taj <- c("<a href= 'https://www.tajmahal.gov.in/view_taj.html' >Taj Mahal</a>")
leaflet() %>%
addTiles() %>%
addMarkers(lat=27.173891, lng=78.042068, popup = Taj)
```
The Marker pointed on the map shows the exact location of The Taj Mahal.
